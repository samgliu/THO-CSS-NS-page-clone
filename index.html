                        A purported ancient lake on Mars may have been far
                        smaller than researchers thought. NASA’s Curiosity rover
                        has been
                        <span class="blue">exploring Gale crater</span> for more
                        than eight years, and while early observations suggested
                        the entire crater may once have been filled with water,
                        a new analysis implies that it just had a series of
                        ponds instead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Previous analyses of data from Curiosity have relied
                        heavily on a measure called the chemical index of
                        alteration to determine how rocks were weathered over
                        time. <span class="blue">Joseph Michalski</span> at the
                        University of Hong Kong and his colleagues have
                        suggested that because this measure was developed for
                        use on Earth, it may not be valid in the extreme Martian
                        climate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instead, they analysed the concentrations of various
                        compounds that are expected to change based on different
                        types of weathering over time. They found that some of
                        the layers of rock Curiosity examined did interact with
                        water at some point in their past, but more are likely
                        to have formed outside of the water.

                        “Over hundreds of metres of strata, it seems that the
                        only layers that are demonstrably lacustrine [formed in
                        a lake] are the lower few metres,” says Michalski. “Of
                        the rocks visited by the rover… the fraction that is
                        demonstrably lacustrine is something like 1 per cent.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These rocks were mostly in the lowest few metres of
                        <span class="blue">sediments in the crater</span>,
                        suggesting the lake was not nearly as deep or extensive
                        as we thought. “There was likely a small lake or more
                        likely a series of small lakes in the floor of Gale
                        crater, but these were shallow ponds,” says Michalski.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rocks that didn’t form in water appeared to be
                        volcanic, so Michalski says that they may have formed
                        out of ash from volcanic eruptions after the water in
                        Gale crater had dried up. Observations by other Mars
                        missions have hinted that these sediments were deposited
                        by wind, not water, so this may solve that mismatch.
